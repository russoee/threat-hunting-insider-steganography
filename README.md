# 🕵️ Threat Hunting Case Study: Insider Exfiltration via Steganography

This project documents a full threat hunting investigation using **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** and **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** to uncover a simulated insider threat. It traces the attacker's actions from accessing sensitive documents to hiding them within image files and staging them for exfiltration via removable media.

## 📌 Scenario Summary

An internal user (`bmontgomery`) accessed confidential PDF and Excel documents, used **`steghide.exe`** to embed them into `.bmp` images, and then compressed the images into an encrypted archive using **`7z.exe`**. The archive was staged and later renamed for stealth.

Through endpoint telemetry and file hash correlation, this case study reconstructs the entire exfiltration chain.
